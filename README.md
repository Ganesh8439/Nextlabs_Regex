# A regex to extract numbers
# Summary
This code is used to extract error numbers from a text that has error codes and a error message after that
# Logic
Assuming all texts contains error numbers first and displaying the error message at the end we split the text using the word **message** and using regular expression library we extract all the numbers from the first part of the text
